# Project

This project mainly involved an efficient solution to deal with the questions of playing Poker game, including how to identify different types of cards as well as the procedure of how to detemine the winners. Also, it had been fully commented by the specific annotations, allowing readers to easily understand each part of it. 

This project addressed a range of techniques, e.g.:
1. how to properly operate some well-know collections (List, Set, Map) in Java.
2. how to logiclly abstract numerous classes by using the idea of OOP (Object-oriented Programming).
3. how to warp up and to organize a class for reducing redundant code.
I tried to make each part clearly and detailedly for those junior developers. While if you are a senior developer, you can leave out some long comments. 

Additionally, the Poker class is the launcher of this project.
